# Fit Model by Suitable Variable with Python
The attach file is the assignment I did with other 2 teammate when I was studying bachelor of science in managenment mathematics with computing at Tun Abdul Rahman University College. This assignment is try to fit the linear and multiple linear regression model with suitable variable by using the data(“LifeExpectancy.csv”)from kaggle.

### Summary
At first, we just select the data in Year 2011 until 2015 and fill in the null data with their mean. After that, we find the correlation between the variable to decide the suitable variable to fit the model. The variable we choose for linear regression model is income composition of resources and the variable for other two multiple linear regression model is income composition of resources, Adult Mortality and income composition of resources, Adult Mortality, Schooling respectively。

Leastly, We use the adjusted R to decide the best model and find the 95% confidence interval of life expectancy with income composition of resources = 0.65 and Adult Mortality = 200. The confidence (or prediction) interval we found for an income composition of resources index of 0.65 and an adult mortality rate of 200 per 1000 population is 68.29622302, 68.83006992
